## Synopsis

This is the final project for the Getting and Cleeaning Data Course on Coursera. The script in this assignment does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Code Example

To set up the R script either download the .zip file yourself at "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip", and filename
or uncomment the lines in the script to have it done for you.

To run the script, in R, source the file "run_analasys.R" and the view the result data.table. The result data.tabe is also uploaded in this repository as "result.txt".
